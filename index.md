# Hedgerows in the Sky
Today in 2023, the food sovereignty and tech sovereignty movements are united in the call for more cooperative production methods and a commitment to common-pool resources. There is an increasing degree of interchange and direct collaboration between their communities, and clear parallels can be drawn between their respective practices. One can compare collectivized farm management to cooperative data trusts; free fridges and other mutual aid food programs to the communal administration of decentralized social media networks; sliding scale food coops or CSA solidarity shares to software projects sponsored through Liberapay, OpenCollective, donate buttons or some combination of crowdfunding mechanisms.

Turn back the clock by ten or twenty years, however, and those correspondences were not as conspicuous. While notions of collective autonomy can be insinuated from the local food and free-culture movements of that era, and indeed many practitioners were already formulating those concepts within their respective disciplines, neither food sovereignty nor tech sovereignty had yet gained much popular recognition. Accordingly, there was very little dialogue between the two movements, with few opportunities for their divergent fields to collaborate, share resources or swap notes. The small farming and local food movements of that era fixated on what was near-at-hand, low-tech, organic, provincial and professedly slow. Meanwhile, the free-culture and open source movements set their gaze on global streams of non-rivalrous information, liberated by their abstractness and cutting-edge technology to travel across all borders, effortlessly and instantaneously.

This article will examine the convergent evolution of these two movements by surveying the relevant technological milestones and sociopolitical developments of the intervening years. For a more subjective view, I offer the story of my own encounters with each of these movements, while also situating them within the longer history of agriculture, information technology and the Commons. Finally, I'll reflect on the latest initiatives that have emerged through their union and what synergies remain to be explored.

## Finding Community
A little over a year ago, I sat with a dozen or so engineers, agronomists, designers and soil scientists, clustered around a couple hastily arranged tables. It was an "unconference"[^unconf] session titled "Justice for Nature."[^J4N] Groups of two or three would periodically split off to pursue a tangent then rejoin the rest, while others hung in loose orbit around the edges occasionally leaning in to pick up the main thread of conversation. Across the wide, high-ceilinged hall and its adjoining patios, three or four similar groups convened on topics ranging from semantic data formats to climate resilience. Two days earlier we had all converged on the Omega Center in Rhinebeck, NY for the second ever large-scale Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology — GOAT 2022, for short.

I had been there for the first such gathering in 2018. It had a profound effect on me, the kind of "found my people" moment you're lucky to have only once or twice in a lifetime. Back then, our conversations centered around how best to convince farmers of the benefits of open source software, along with perennial issues like interoperability and design methods. When I arrived this time, I didn't expect a second life-altering event, but in those three days I had witnessed a new shared awareness emerging about the role of the commons in both agriculture and technology. Four years of accelerating climate change, ongoing police violence, housing shortages, supply chain disruptions and a global pandemic had clearly shifted our attentions.

Samuel Oslund, then at CAPÉ[^CAPE] and the University of Quebec, directed the conversation towards the Amish _Ordnung_, in essence a code of conduct or rules each community formulates for itself. _Ordnung_ does not ban technology outright, but prescribes a selection process that may include evaluation by community elders, probationary trial periods, and group consensus. From our superficial understanding, we saw it as a means of socializing technology adoption, with localized control and intent. The entire community took ownership of any externalities (if they could still be called that), and through collective action they could adjust course at any time. Sam's comments yielded the following prompt from our facillitator, Dr. LaKisha Odom, Scientific Program Director at FFAR:[^LaKisha] "Could GOAT develop a technological assessment framework to help developers consider the impacts of their technologies on nature?"

The response that stood out to me most came from Genna Fudin, an OpenTEAM Fellow working with Quivira Coalition and Point Blue Conservation Science.[^Genna] She proposed that technology should seek to expand access to nature and never restrict it. That did not mean access solely for the individual user, or even all humanity, but for every living thing on the planet. Her remarks struck me like a bolt, catalyzing an array of ideas that had been swimming around my head over the last three days, finally snapping them into place. As I struggled to articulate all of it, I asked to read aloud some antiquated English folk poetry, which I'd been mulling over earlier in the day.

I'd first heard these anonymous lines in an interview with historian Peter Linebaugh, commemorating the 800th anniversary of the signing of _Magna Carta_. I remember because it was also the moment I first learned about the longer history of the English commons and, more importantly, the process of its enclosure.
