# Hedgerows in the Sky
Today in 2023, the food sovereignty and tech sovereignty movements are united in the call for more cooperative production methods and a commitment to common-pool resources. There is an increasing degree of interchange and direct collaboration between their communities, and clear parallels can be drawn between their respective practices. One can compare collectivized farm management to cooperative data trusts; free fridges and other mutual aid food programs to the communal administration of decentralized social media networks; sliding scale food coops or CSA solidarity shares to software projects sponsored through Liberapay, OpenCollective, donate buttons or some combination of crowdfunding mechanisms.

Turn back the clock by ten or twenty years, however, and those correspondences were not as conspicuous. While notions of collective autonomy can be insinuated from the local food and free-culture movements of that era, and indeed many practitioners were already formulating those concepts within their respective disciplines, neither food sovereignty nor tech sovereignty had yet gained much popular recognition. Accordingly, there was very little dialogue between the two movements, with few opportunities for their divergent fields to collaborate, share resources or swap notes. The small farming and local food movements of that era fixated on what was near-at-hand, low-tech, organic, provincial and professedly slow. Meanwhile, the free-culture and open source movements set their gaze on global streams of non-rivalrous information, liberated by their abstractness and cutting-edge technology to travel across all borders, effortlessly and instantaneously.

This article will examine the convergent evolution of these two movements by surveying the relevant technological milestones and sociopolitical developments of the intervening years. For a more subjective view, I offer the story of my own encounters with each of these movements, while also situating them within the longer history of agriculture, information technology and the Commons. Finally, I'll reflect on the latest initiatives that have emerged through their union and what synergies remain to be explored.

## Finding Community
A little over a year ago, I sat amidst a dozen or so engineers, agronomists, designers and soil scientists, clustered around a couple of hastily arranged tables, all deep in conversation. Groups of two or three would split off periodically to pursue a question more thoroughly then rejoin the rest, while others hung in loose orbit around the edges occasionally leaning in to pick up the main topic of discussion: "Justice for Nature." Across the wide, high-ceilinged hall and its adjoining patios, three or four similar groups convened on topics ranging from geospatial and semantic data formats to organic certification and climate resilience. We had all converged two days earlier on the Omega Center in Rhinebeck, NY for the second ever large-scale Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology, or GOAT 2022.

I had been present, too, for the first such gathering in 2018, which had been an utterly revelatory event for me, the kind of "found my people" moment you're lucky to have only once or twice in a lifetime. By 2022, I felt old hat, but I recognized a new understanding emerging, both for myself and the group at large, about the role of the commons in both agriculture and technology. It's a testament to the patience and open-mindedness of my fellow attendees that my request to read aloud some antiquated English folk poetry was met with encouragement, rather than the eye-rolls it probably deserved. It began:

> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose off the common  
> But leaves the greater villain loose  
> Who steals the common from the goose.  

The prompt had been, "Is it possible to develop a technological assessment framework to help us consider the impacts of our technologies on nature?"
