# Hedgerows in the Sky
When I tell people I make free and open source software (FOSS) for farmers...

<!-- TODO: Introduction -->

## The Stolen Commons
A little over a year ago, I sat with a dozen or so engineers, agronomists,
designers and soil scientists, clustered around a couple hastily arranged
tables. It was an "unconference"[^unconf] session titled "Justice for
Nature."[^J4N] Groups of two or three would periodically split off to pursue a
tangent then rejoin the rest, while others hung in loose orbit around the edges
occasionally leaning in to pick up the main thread of conversation. Across the
wide, high-ceilinged hall and its adjoining patios, three or four similar groups
convened on topics ranging from semantic data formats to climate resilience. Two
days earlier we had all converged on the Omega Center in Rhinebeck, NY for the
second ever large-scale Gathering for Open Agricultural Technology — GOAT 2022,
for short.

[^J4N]: https://forum.goatech.org/t/session-J4N/1340

I had been there for the first such gathering in 2018. It had a profound effect
on me, the kind of "found my people" moment you're lucky to have only once or
twice in a lifetime. Back then, our conversations centered around how best to
convince farmers of the benefits of open source software, along with perennial
issues like interoperability and design methods. When I arrived this time, I
didn't expect a second life-altering event, but in those three days I had
witnessed a new shared awareness emerging about the role of the commons in both
agriculture and technology. Four years of accelerating climate change, ongoing
police violence, housing shortages, supply chain disruptions and a global
pandemic had clearly shifted our attentions.

Samuel Oslund, then at CAPÉ[^CAPE] and the University of Quebec, directed the
conversation towards the Amish _Ordnung_, in essence a code of conduct or rules
each community formulates for itself. _Ordnung_ does not ban technology
outright, but prescribes a selection process that may include evaluation by
community elders, probationary trial periods, and group consensus. From our
superficial understanding, we saw it as a means of socializing technology
adoption, with localized control and intent. The entire community took ownership
of any externalities (if they could still be called that), and through
collective action they could adjust course at any time. Sam's comments yielded
the following prompt from our facillitator, Dr. LaKisha Odom, Scientific Program
Director at FFAR:[^LaKisha] "Could GOAT develop a technological assessment
framework to help developers consider the impacts of their technologies on
nature?"

The response that stood out to me most came from Genna Fudin, an OpenTEAM Fellow
working with Quivira Coalition and Point Blue Conservation Science.[^Genna] She
proposed that technology should seek to expand access to nature and never
restrict it. That did not mean access solely for the individual user, or even
all humanity, but for every living thing on the planet. Her remarks struck me
like a bolt, catalyzing an array of ideas that had been swimming around my head
over the last three days, finally snapping them into place. I struggled to
articulate it, so I asked to read aloud some antiquated English folk poetry,
which I'd been mulling over earlier in the week.

[^Genna]: https://openteam.community/genna-fudin-openteam-fellow-shares-reflections-thus-far/

> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> But leaves the greater villain loose  
> Who steals the common from off the goose.  

I'd first heard these anonymous lines in an interview with historian Peter
Linebaugh, commemorating the 800th anniversary of _Magna Carta_. He was
discussing its lesser known companion, the _Charter of the Forest_, which
protected the peasantry's rights to forage and graze their animals on common
lands. It was the first time I'd heard the longer history of the English
commons, how it was enshrined in the English constitution and only phased out by
a gradual process called enclosure that took centuries to complete. Enclosure is
exactly what it sounds like: closing off common pasture or forest by means of
fences, hedges or by blocking roads so that it's no longer accessible to the
common peasantry. More recently I was reminded of the poem when Linebaugh
recited it once again in an interview with David Bollier, a fact I would soon
come to realize was no coincidence.

Genna's comments fused together the final conceptual links between enclosure,
which though obscure is at least a fairly plain matter of historical record,
and the more erudite legal and socioeconomic theories I'd been reading about but
struggling to grasp. I couldn't really get my head around the principle of
"usufruct" and its distinction from real property rights (_jus in re propria_).
Usufruct grants the rightsholder both the free use of an asset as well as the
profits or other material gains that arise from it. These are termed _usus_ and
_fructus_ in civil law, respectively, and hence _usufruct_. Real property
ownership grants all of that plus the right to dispose of the asset (_abusus_)
however one sees fit. That can include consuming, selling, irrevocably modifying
or destroying it.[^jus] What I struggled with most was how the entitlement to
use an asset and its products differed substantially from the right to sell or
consume it. Weren't those just other ways to use it? It seemed redundant.

[^jus]: In civil or Roman law, the Latin terms would translate:
    [_jus in re propria_](https://www.lsd.law/define/jus-in-re-propria),
    "right to [one's] own thing";
    [_jus utendi_](https://www.lsd.law/define/jus-utendi), "right to use" or literally "the using";
    [_jus in fructu_](https://www.lsd.law/define/in-fructu), "right to the fruit [of a thing]";
    [_jus abutendi_](https://www.lsd.law/define/jus-abutendi), "right to use up" as in "to expend"

Now when I thought about it in the light of universal access to nature, I
remembered the other term for this third right: _alienation_. In a strictly
legal sense, to alienate an asset carries little further significance than to
"dispose of" it, but in a sociological context or in plain parlance, alienation
imbues a psychological or spiritual effect. That sense seems all the more acute
when the thing you are alienating is nature itself, even if just a part of it.
There is reciprocity between us and nature, a two-way subjectivity that
transcends the mere owner/asset duality. I belong to nature as much as (or more
than) nature belongs to me, and to sever that tie would constitute a terrible
injury. To enclose nature, therefore, means to fundamentally set it apart and
commodify it. Enclosure relegates nature to market forces of exchange and
fungibility, as an insensible object and no longer an equal (or greater)
subject. In the process, anyone tied to that chunk of nature is also
commodified, in a two-way process that alienates one from the other. This holds
true whether the "thing of nature" is a strip of land closed off by a fence or
hedgerow, or intellectual property (IP) like software or digital media.

The most effective means of enclosing intellectual property, I would argue, has
been to consolidate it in the vast data centers and server farms of tech
monopolies. Access can then be sold off in the form of subscriptions or
advertising fees. That way, the IP owner retains maximum control, with the
ability to revoke access or modify the terms of service at any time. This
practice goes by many names. The industry jargon is Software-as-a-Service, or
SaaS, while it is marketed to lay users in more poetic terms: _the Cloud_.
Opponents of cloud computing and proprietary software have quipped that this is
just a euphemism for "someone else's computer." I would propose that, trading
grandiose metaphor for grandiose metaphor, we instead rebrand the cloud as the
modern enclosure it really is: _hedgerows in the sky_.

The hedgerows that enclosed the English commons of the 16th through 18th
centuries did not go unopposed, but were actively resisted over many
generations. Among the earliest of these were the Levellers, who first earned
that name during the Midland Revolt of 1607 by "levelling" hedgerows in protest.
Though some were drawn and quartered for their convictions, their example
inspired the True Levellers, or Diggers, of the English Revolution some 40 years
later. The anonymous bard I quoted above, whoever they were, surely knew
something of this resistance, and perhaps they even participated in it.
Therefore, it's not hard to hear both a warning and a call-to-arms in their
final stanza:

> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> And geese will still a common lack  
> Till they go and steal it back.  

If we were to heed their call, how would we begin levelling today's hedgerows?

## The Forgotten Enclosures
I was a bit surprised to realize my ignorance of the parallels between modern
software commons and premodern agricultural commons, but after speaking to
others at GOAT, it became clear I was not alone. This was doubly true with the
concept of enclosure. What was especially embarrassing to me was how many of us
had carved out niche careers straddling both open technology and small-scale
agriculture, spanning decades in some cases, yet few of us had more than a
cursory knowledge of the history of the commons predating the Information Age.

The metaphor of "the commons" has become so pervasive in technology today. The
first time I recall encountering it was from the Free Culture Movement of the
early and mid-2000's. Its most prominent manifestation came in the form of
Creative Commons, but the commons had also become a familiar means of
characterizing crowd-sourced projects like Wikipedia, Flickr and the World Wide
Web itself. The Free Culture Movement first gained momentum in the wake of the
US Copyright Term Extension Act (aka, the Sonny Bono Act) and Digital Millennium
Copyright Act (DMCA), both enacted in 1998. These drew immediate outcry from a
clique of law professors at Duke and Harvard Universities, who specialized in
intellectual property. The outcry became more public and vociferous when the
DMCA was used first to pull the plug on Napster in 2001, followed by its many
file-sharing successors in a decade-long game of whack-a-mole with the RIAA and
MPAA. This was the heyday of the Free Culture Movement. Its unofficial motto,
"Information wants to be free," resonated with anyone who got a cease-and-desist
letter from their Internet provider (myself included) or who merely saw the
futility of police raids on sites like The Pirate Bay, when they'd just be back
up and running within a day or two.

Among the Free Culture Movement's coterie of legal scholars, Lawrence Lessig and
Yochai Benkler were arguably its most visible champions, both hailing from
Harvard's Berkman Klein Center for Internet & Society. In the first few years
this was largely on account of the numerous amicus briefs they filed in support
of defendants in copyright infringement cases. Later on, their published books
and several widely viewed TED Talks extended their reach to a larger audience.
For a few short years, concepts like "remix culture" and "network neutrality"
enjoyed a glimmer of popular recognition. In the first decade of the new
millennium, their work certainly raised public awareness of "the commons" and
why it was important. This was particularly true among the more technologically
savvy, but not exclusively. On the other hand, it does not seem that enclosure
enjoyed any wider awareness during that period, at least not commensurate with
the commons. Speaking for myself, I remained oblivious to the term until I
learned it from Linebaugh in 2015. That was a decade after Lessig cofounded
Creative Commons and Benkler had popularized the notion of "commons-based peer
production." For his part, Benkler put both the commons and enclosure front and
center in his earliest essays on the topic, such as "The Commons As A Neglected
Factor of Information Policy" and "Free as the Air to Common Use: First
Amendment Constraints on Enclosure of the Public Domain," from 1998 and 1999,
respectively. I haven't found anything more than passing references to enclosure
in Lessig's works. Regardless, it didn't seem to make as many inroads with
technologists the way the commons had.

There were other figures, however, who I don't personally recall from the Free
Culture Movement's highpoint of popularity, and who didn't receive as much
limelight, but who nevertheless turned out to be consequential to the history of
the knowledge commons. First was James Boyle, one of the Duke Law professors
specializing in IP and building on the work of his colleagues at Duke, such as
David Lange and Jerome Reichman. I don't believe I'd encountered Boyle's work
until after GOAT 2022, when I went looking for a deeper understanding of how the
language of the commons came to be embraced by free culture and open source
advocates of the last two decades, while enclosure went comparatively ignored.
As early as 1996, Boyle penned a pivotal work in the study of information
commons, _Shamans, Software, and Spleens_, but it was a later title that jumped
out to me from all the rest: "The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction
of the Public Domain." The paper began with the epigraph:

> The law locks up the man or woman [...]

Now the pieces were starting to fall into place. I tracked the discourse of
enclosure through Boyle's footnotes, where he acknowledges that "the analogy to
the enclosure movement has been too succulent to resist," and proceeds to give a
laundry list of names from that scholarly milieu who had used it too. Yochai
Benkler was listed there, of course, along with a few more names I was hitherto
unaware of, like Hannibal Travis, whose 1999 _Pirates of the Information
Infrastructure_ is the best combined survey of the pre-industrial enclosure
movement together with this "second enclosure movement," as Boyle calls it.

Boyle also names the aforementioned David Bollier, who would eventually
reintroduce me to Peter Linebaugh's work, but who was also quite active in the
early days of the "blogosphere" and advocating for Internet freedom. While he
was not an IP lawyer, he was the co-founder of the advocacy organizations Public
Knowledge and Commons Strategies Group, and today is Director of the Reinventing
the Commons Program at the Schumacher Center for a New Economics. In these
roles, he has advanced a much broader vision for the commons, not just for
information but for the commons in all its forms. Accompanying this, he has
articulated a thorough critique of enclosure, in all its own manifestations. A
slightly different version of "stealing the commons from off the goose" shows up
as the epigraph to Bollier's _Silent Theft: The Private Plunder of Our Common
Wealth_ in 2002, the same year Boyle published an early draft of his own
essay featuring the poem. As it turns out, Peter Linebaugh also found it "too
succulent to resist" and recycled it once more in the introduction to his 2014
book _Stop, Thief!_. Linebaugh was winking at Bollier when he recited
it back to him in their interview, I'm sure.

Apart from being the object in this game of epigraphic hot potato, it's not
surprising that the poem rose to the surface as a shared metaphor in such an
atmosphere of cross-disciplinary collaboration. Looking at the participants list
from the _Conference on the Public Domain_ that was held at Duke Law School in
2001,[^conf-pub-dom] I can't help but speculate who might have first quoted the
goose poem there, and how I may have unwittingly parodied that scene two decades
later in Rhinebeck. If the culprit wasn't Bollier or Boyle, there was certainly
no shortage of other suspects, including Elinor Ostrom, Charlotte Hess, John
Perry Barlow and even Mark Hosler of the band Negativland, who facilitated a
round-table discussion titled "Art Crime / Crime Art." The list also includes
Yochai Benkler and "Larry" Lessig, but somehow I doubt it was either of them who
first brought the goose poem to the others' attention. In those heady post-Cold
War days, even liberals like Lessig and Benkler took Francis Fukuyama's "end of
history" as practically axiomatic, at least in _serious_ political discourse.
With its distinctly revolutionary tone and the memory of bourgeois enclosures it
chronicled, I suspect the poem may have seemed either too radical or too
ridiculous to many in attendance. In any event, the more celebrated proponents
of free culture seem to have shied away from the metaphors of enclosure or
_actual communal land tenure_ when discussing the commons. As the Free Culture
Movement grew over the next decade, the commons may have gained a hold in
popular imaginations, but enclosure decidedly did not, no matter how
"irresistibly succulent" it may have seemed at first.

[^conf-pub-dom]: The [_Conference on the Public
    Domain_](https://www.tech-insider.org/internet/research/2001/1109.html).

As Bollier points out in _Silent Theft_, by omitting enclosure from the metaphor
of the commons, the adversarial role of markets is conveniently ignored:

> It is important to speak of market enclosure because it reframes the economic
> narrative of the market. What the market considers incidental externalities
> (toxic waste, species extinction, safety hazards), the narrative of the
> commons regards as an assault on the community. Marketeers presume an
> entitlement to privatize clean air and water, public spaces, and even shared
> images and words.

I would go even further to say that this subtle omission of enclosure — and with
it the more tangible aspects of the commons — erases the acts of violence and
the sheer _physical force_ that was required to enclose the commons. Skipping
over that transgenerational struggle not only does an injustice to those who
fought and died for the commons, but also limits our imaginations for what is
possible in our own time.

I want to be clear that neither Benkler nor Lessig were arguing that these
physical aspects did not matter. In _The Wealth of Networks_, Benkler provides a
truly insightful table that breaks down different forms of enclosure in terms of
its physical, logical, and content layers, explicitly borrowing from the OSI
Model for computer networks. And it was Lessig's arguments for the end-to-end
architecture of the Internet, in both physical and logical terms, which first
led me to Boyle's essay on enclosure.

Nevertheless, today's advocates for free culture and open source software are
still mostly concerned with commoning what is abstract and ephemeral, though
there are significant exceptions I will address later on. The hardware and
infrastructure required to store, process and move information around are
treated as mere accidents or technical details. If they're considered at all
they're taken as inconveniences to be worked around in policy, possibly
subsidized, but never as substantive elements of the knowledge commons in their
own right. Information acquires a supernatural character in this formulation. It
is beyond the encumbrances of the physical world. Even the Swedish police who
raided The Pirate Bay in 2006 had to concede that there were limits to what
could be done to physically impede the flow of information. Information, after
all, wants to be free.

Yet the cost of disregarding information's earthly trappings is borne out by the
way private streaming platforms have nonetheless managed to enclose the
knowledge commons, quite thoroughly and in relatively short time. Jump ahead
twenty years from when it seemed like Napster and torrenting would spell the
death of copyright, we see subscription rates for platforms such as Netflix
steadily rising ever year, while fewer titles are available outside premium
plans and mid-roll ads become longer and more frequent. This is how today's big
platforms rake in more revenue than the premium cable channels of yesteryear
ever dreamed was possible. It's also how our common cultural heritage continues
to be enclosed. The DMCA, takedown notices and high profile raids played their
role in all this, of course, but the commons was not lost due to licensing and
regulation alone. In many ways it was precisely because the call for a knowledge
commons stopped there. Beyond the fiber lines and standards like TCP/IP, it fell
short of demanding any kind of public infrastructure that might have held such
enclosures in check. Even the FCC's classification of Internet service providers
(ISPs) as "common carriers," thereby subject to net neutrality regulation, has
been stripped away in the last decade. Meanwhile, physical servers, databases,
and most of all the considerable administration required to maintain those
systems have largely been taken for granted, almost as a fact of nature.

## The Commons that Never Were Enclosed
Designating something _a fact of nature_ can just as readily demonstrate
reverence as it can cast disdain. The double meaning, though seemingly
contradictory, is the same rhetoric that colonialist projects have used for
centuries in order to justify the enclosure of both physical resources and
indigenous knowledge.

Nearly a decade before Benkler, Boyle and Bollier drew the comparison between
copyright expansion and enclosure — reacting to the passage of the DMCA and
Sonny Bono Act of 1998 — Dr. Vandana Shiva cited the history of enclosure in
response to a suite of international treaties and free trade agreements
negotiated between 1989 and 1993. This was the legal framework that created the
World Trade Organization (WTO), heralding a new era of unfettered globalization.
Shiva represented the Research Foundation for Science, Technology & Ecology
(RFSTE), an organization comprised of scientists, conservationists, feminists,
and peasant farmers. They resolutely opposed the environmental degradation and
capitalist appropriation the WTO was poised to accelerate, the effects of which
were already apparent in their cities and villages. Among the settlements was a
treaty obligation to uphold intellectual property rights (IPR) granted by other
signatory nations. This was of particular concern to Shiva because chemical
companies were seeking patents that would privatize the germplasm of plants that
Indian farmers had previously bred and cultivated. An exemplary case was that of
neem, a native plant seed and the oil it produces, which had been carefully bred
over the course of 2,000 years by Indian farmers for use as a natural and highly
effective insect repellent. Now foreign corporations claimed those innovations
for themselves — claims eventually supported by both the European Patent Office
and USDA — all for the purpose of selling the seed back to farmers at a
profit.[^biopiracy-campaign]

Shiva did not mince words. In her 1997 book, _Biopiracy_, she decried the
inherent hostility to life that hid behind globalization's facade of free trade,
free enterprise, and free markets:
