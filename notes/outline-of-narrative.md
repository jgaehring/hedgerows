# Outline of the Main Narrative
## Three Part Essay Series
I'm realizing this material really can't all fit into one essay, so I'm settling
on making this 3 separate essays for now, although I first considered taking the
4 main headings from my [original outline](#old-outline) and making each of
those a separate essay. It makes better sense though to combine those middle two
headings (my experiences with FOSS and local food, respectively), reverse their
order so I can bring agriculture more into focus before its relevance gets lost,
then condense them so my own story takes up far less space than it would have.
That way I should be able to address the beginnings of the Food Sovereignty
movement that was happening concurrently with my own journey, all within the
same essay. Then the third and final essay can tie everything back together,
covering some of the more recent theory on the commons as well as the current
developments of the food and tech sovereignty movements and how they are
discovering new synergies for restoring the commons in the future.
