# Outline of the Main Narrative
## Three Part Essay Series
I'm realizing this material really can't all fit into one essay, so I'm settling
on making this 3 separate essays for now, although I first considered taking the
4 main headings from my [original outline](#old-outline) and making each of
those a separate essay. It makes better sense though to combine those middle two
headings (my experiences with FOSS and local food, respectively), reverse their
order so I can bring agriculture more into focus before its relevance gets lost,
then condense them so my own story takes up far less space than it would have.
That way I should be able to address the beginnings of the Food Sovereignty
movement that was happening concurrently with my own journey, all within the
same essay. Then the third and final essay can tie everything back together,
covering some of the more recent theory on the commons as well as the current
developments of the food and tech sovereignty movements and how they are
discovering new synergies for restoring the commons in the future.

I'm including a short abstract for each part below, followed by its outline.

### Part 1: Concerning knowledge enclosures and how they may be truly leveled
The connections between free and open source software (FOSS) and sustainable
farming movements are examined by looking at the practical and metaphorical use
of historical techniques of commoning[^commoning] that each has alternatively
employed or discarded within their respective movements. While the free software
community has been far more explicit in embracing the commons since its
inception, it has narrowed the permissable scope of the "commonable" to what is
strictly abstract and ephemeral: namely, information. A historiography of land
enclosure is then recounted, showing how this critical counterpart to the
commons has been ignored or forgotten in its more recent depictions. Viewed as a
proxy for the physical and contingent aspects of the commons, and how the
commons can be lost if collective vigilance is not paid, the history of
political resistance to enclosure can be instructive for how the commons might
be restored today.

[^commoning]: I.e., the traditional forms of communal land tenure once
    prevalent in England and Europe from at least the 12th through 18th
    centuries.

### Part 2: A tale of two movements
The notion of the commons was conspicuously absent from the discourse of the
slow food movement and sustainable agriculture in the U.S. during the
Clinton-Bush years. Even as more antiquated and provincial modes of producing
and consuming food came into vogue, the "locavore" and small family farming
movements adhered more closely to a characteristically American narrative of the
homesteader or the "rock-star" chef, an individualistic and isolationist stance
that is sharply at odds with the historical (or the contemporary majority
world's) model of smallholder farming and traditional foodways. It was left to
more radical voices emerging from the Occupy and hacktivist movements in the
early- to mid-2010's to breathe new life into a vision for the commons in
America. Meanwhile, the rest of the world never gave up the fight, and the
resultant food sovereignty movement and peasant food webs are finally getting
the attention of some of us here in the Northern Hemisphere.

### Part 3: Towards the unified commons of food, land, and technology
The commons never went away; many ways of practicing, thinking and writing about
the commons were always there, even in the U.S. and Europe, if you knew where to
look: from the Fourierists and Owenites of the 19th century and Georgists of the
Progressive Era, to the Marxian economists and historians of the Cold War Era
and the proponents of degrowth and municipalism who are still active today. No
critique of these movements' lasting impacts or full potentiality would be
complete, however, without a deep understanding of how enclosure has been
carried out on a mass scale in the form of Western Colonialism. The
ramifications touch upon food, land use, technology and the information economy
and show how the commons must be reconceived as encompassing all forms of
resource allocation if its restoration is to be achieved in our lifetimes.
