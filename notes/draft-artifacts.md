## Conclusions
Enclosure is more than just a simple barrier or boundary: it is a severing of
the ties that connect us to other people and living creatures, while uprooting
us from the land and, more generally, our sense of place.

Both knowledge and land must be given back to the whole at some point

Technology and open source software became deeply politicized for me in 2012 in
a way that food and farming had never been.

## Medieval Commons and Their Holdovers
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, "The Institutional Aspects of Peasant Communities: An
Analytical View" (1965):

> pasture" in England, _vaine pâture_ in France and _Gemenglad der Felder_ in
> Germany. According to it, after harvest all fields are opened for pasture to

Open field agriculture was prevalent in Ireland, too, where it was called
rundale, until those farmers were dispossessed by English settlers and the
plantation system, starting in the 1580's. This was an important proving ground
for Britain's colonial methods, which they would later perfect in the
expropriation of the Americas' common landholdings, from Virginia to Belize. In
the Scottish Highlands, the similarly named run-rig system continued through the
late 18th century, coinciding with the Scottish Enlightenment that produced _The
Wealth of Nations_ and a wave of land privatization consistent with that book's
core tenets. Today, the village of
[Laxton](http://www.laxtonvisitorcentre.org.uk/), Nottinghamshire, retains the
last open field system in England. Three fields are still held in common
ownership, little changed from detailed maps of the area from 1635. A fourth
field was lost only in 1903, during the final era of Parliamentary enclosure.
The farmers of Laxton — in a sophisticated practice combining regular crop
rotation and fallow periods, intermittent grazing and permanent pasture lanes —
are apportioned strips of land from each of the fields, a tradition that has
likely endured for over half a millennium.

Elsewhere, the Russian _obshchina_ or _mir_[^mir] persisted in its medieval form
as late as 1861, when Tsar Alexander II emancipated the serfs. It has even been
argued that a kernel of communal land practice held out until the Soviet Union
undertook collectivization in the 1920's. In Mexico, the revolutionary
Constitution of 1917 and subsequent land reforms of Lázaro Cárdenas established
the system of _ejidos_. These remained largely in tact until the relevant
articles of the constitution, which blocked the sale of communal lands to
foreign investors, were repealed at the behest of neoliberal policy makers in
the interest of ratifying NAFTA. The Zapatista uprising was launched the day
NAFTA took effect on January 1, 1994, and to this day the EZLN defends the
communal lands of Chiapas from further enclosures. This is all to say nothing of
the indigenous land practices which have successfully resisted colonial
encroachment and land enclosures for centuries across the globe, but I feel
ill-equipped to speak to that vast history of struggle.

[^mir]: This is indeed the same name given to the Russian space station _Мир_ in
    1986, although the term has a broader meaning that carries with it the sense
    of "world," "planet" and "peace". See _Afterburner_, ["Space Station ´Mir´ –
    the symbol of Soviet supremacy in space, that reconciliated
    nations"](https://afterburner.com.pl/space-station-mir-the-symbol-of-soviet-supremacy-in-space-that-reconciliated-nations/).
    Also, Robert Ellickson backs up that _miri_ were still in practice as
    late as Stalin's collectivization ("Property in Land" p. 1393)


## Twitter Revolutions, _Revolution OS_, and Helicopters at 1am
The Free Culture Movement, or the principles it advocated for, were at least on
my radar throughout the aughts. This was out of naked self-interest if nothing
else. I was a broke 20-something, trying to make rent on my Loisaida apartment
while struggling first to get through college and then through a global
recession. I also had a taste for obscure music and films, and in that
primordial age before Spotify and Netflix, torrenting was my best if not only
option. Somewhere between late 2011 and early 2012, however, I gained a whole
new appreciation for the meaning of information freedom.

In the early hours of November 15, 2011, I woke up to the sound of many, many
helicopters flying low and fast over Manhattan, their powerful spotlights
strobing across my bedroom window. The occasional late night NYPD chopper was
nothing out of the ordinary in Bloomberg's cleaner, friendlier, post-9/11 New
York City, but this was another level of intensity. It took a few unsuccessful
attempts to fall back asleep before I realized where they were likely heading.
The commotion had woken my roommate, too, so we went to the roof for a better
look. There wasn't much to see, just the lights from a dozen or more helicopters
scanning the rooftops and empty city streets, mostly concentrated about a mile
and a half south of us. Still, we knew what it meant: they were raiding the
encampment in Zuccotti Park. The cops, the bankers and their good pal the mayor
had all had enough, and they were finally putting an end to Occupy Wall Street.

Like a lot of New Yorkers, I had been quietly supportive of the movement, joined
a couple rallies when it seemed convenient, but didn't guess it posed much of a
threat to the halls of power — and that was too bad. This crackdown seemed
entirely out of proportion though. In the weeks that followed, I learned plenty
that made me think maybe powerful people did have some reason to worry: there
was the vast sum of money anonymously donated to police union in the weeks prior
to the raid; the restraining order issued by State Supreme Court Justice Lucy
Billings and the cavalier way it was ignored by Bloomberg and the cops; the
brazen assaults against members of the press; just the sheer expenditure of
resources and the political gamble they were willing to take to stamp it out
once and for all. Something clearly made them rate Occupy more of a threat than
I had.

While those impressions were still fresh, SOPA/PIPA...


## Stealing the Commons from off the Goose
via James Boyle's 2003 ["The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of
the Public Domain"](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol66/iss1/2/):


> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> But leaves the greater villain loose  
> Who steals the common from off the goose.  
>   
> The law demands that we atone  
> When we take things we do not own  
> But leaves the lords and ladies fine  
> Who take things that are yours and mine.  
>   
> The poor and wretched don’t escape  
> If they conspire the law to break;

>   
> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> And geese will still a common lack  
> Till they go and steal it back.  

Boyle's essay, as published by Duke Law in 2003, provides the most thorough
commentary on the poem's provenance, at least that I have found to-date:

> Apart from being anonymous, the poem is extremely hard to date. It probably
> comes from the enclosure controversies of the eighteenth century. However, the
> earliest reference to it that I have been able to discover is from 1821.
> Edward Birch was moved to compose some (fairly poor) verses in response when
> he reported “seeing the following jeu d’esprit in a Handbill posted up in
> Plaistow, as a ‘CAUTION’ to prevent persons from supporting the intended
> inclosure of Hainault or Waltham Forest.” He then quotes a version of the
> poem. Edward Birch, TICKLER MAG., Feb. 1821, at 45. In 1860, a staff writer

> discovering a box full of printed squibs, satires and ballads of the time
> against the acts and those who were supposed to favour them,—the library

The paper from self-ascribed "independent scholar" Dana A. Frieburger, ["John
Thompson, English Philomath — A Question of Land Surveying and
Astronomy"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718033403/https://www3.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/index.html),
is available on the Internet Archive. Contemporaneously with Boyle, or even
preceding him by a narrow margin, David Bollier uses a slightly different
version of the poem as an epigraph to his 2002 book, [_Silent Theft: the Private
Plunder of our Common
Wealth_](https://archive.org/details/silenttheftpriva00boll/page/n13/mode/2up)
and a portion of the same for an article in the _Boston Review_, ["Reclaiming
the
Commons"](https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/david-bollier-reclaiming-commons/),
published June 1, 2002. It's unclear if this usage predates Boyle's usage, as
Boyle's first footnote points to an earlier iteration of his paper, titled
["Fencing off ideas: enclosure and the disappearance of the public
domain"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/daedalus.pdf), published in the Spring
2002 edition of _Daedalus_.

Peter Linebaugh's attribution, where he cites the same poem in _Stop, Thief!_,
cites relevant scholarship on the commons from the 20th Century Marxist and
tradition and critical theory, but I have not found specific reference to that
poem in any of these works that I've so far been able to access:

## Historiography of Enclosure
In "The Second Enclosure Movement", Boyle lays out his main thesis plainly:

> We are in the middle of a second enclosure movement. It sounds grandiloquent
to call it “the enclosure of the intangible commons of the mind,” but in a very
real sense that is just what it is. (p. 37)

The footnote to the above reads:

>  The analogy to the enclosure movement has been too succulent to resist. To my
knowledge, Ben Kaplan, Pamela Samuelson, Yochai Benkler, David Lange, Chrisopher
May, David Bollier and Keith Aoki have all employed the trope, as I myself have
on previous occasions. For a particularly thoughtful and careful development of
the parallel between the two enclosure movements, see generally Travis, supra
note 7. (p. 37, n. 12)

Acknowledging Lange, once again:

> Thus, there are a number of possible places where one could say, “the defense
of the public domain begins here.” But, like most people, I attribute central
importance to the writing of my friend and colleague David Lange, whose article
Recognizing the Public Domain really initiated contemporary study of the
subject. (p. 59)

In a telling footnote (p. 176, n. 131), Lange admits:

> I should perhaps say clearly at this point that of course I do not mean to be
> taken literally when I suggest an analogy to public lands. Proposals of that
> sort too quickly lead to analysis rooted in reductive nonsense.

The footnote addresses a rather callous comparison of the public domain to "the
public grazing lands on the Western plains of a century ago," and the
environmental impact statements required for its private use. Yet he qualifies
even that analogy, because "so insubstantial is the stuff of intellelctual
property." He suggests that the Alaskan tundra, "singularly unsuited for
colonization," might make a fairer analogy, before dismissing both as nonsense.

Here's the full context:

> In this final portion of my own essay, I will suggest some other ways courts
> might respond when unwarranted claims of intellectual property are advanced.

Then, after providing the first two methods:

> Third, as an additional part of the plaintiff's prima facie case, it would
> seem fair to require the submission of proof concerning the likely impact that
> recognition of the plaintiff's claim might have on subsequent claims. [...]
> The analogy that comes to mind is the environmental impact statement that must
> be prepared when, for example, government agencies propose to make some
> doubtful use of lands. The purpose of these statements is generally to require
> that, as against the uncontrolled ravages wrought in earlier times, would-be
> users today assure us that their proposals will not heedlessly affect the
> interests of individuals in generations to come.'<sup>129</sup> The analogy
> here seems apt; in certain useful respects the public domain in the field of
> intellectual property today can be compared to the public grazing lands on the
> Western plains of a century ago.<sup>130</sup> Indeed, so insubstantial is the
> stuff of intellectual property that the more insistent image is not the
> sturdier lands of the American West but the more fragile tundra of the Alaskan
> North: wild, vast, inaccessible, beautiful, but singularly unsuited to
> colonization.<sup>131</sup> If it is fair, as we seem to have decided in this
> century it is, to require the users of public lands to prepare impact
> statements as a condition of their use, then perhaps it is also fair to

> 133. _Cf._ Stone, _Should Trees Have Standing?— Toward Legal Rights for
>      Natural Objects_, 45 S. CAL. L. REV. 450 (1972).

Pay special attention to note 133, where he cites Christopher Stone's paper,
today considered a cornerstone of the legal arguments for Rights of Nature.

So dismissing Lange, we come back to Benkler for the earliest comparison of
intellectual property, particularly copyright expansion, to early modern land
enclosures:

> - Free as the Air to Common Use: First Amendment Constraints on Enclosure of
>   the Public Domain, 74 N.Y.U. Law Review 354 (1999)
> - The Commons As A Neglected Factor of Information Policy (TPRC September 98)

Make sure to also acknowledge his _Wealth of Nations_, particularly "Table 11.1:
Overview of the Institutional Ecology," with its 2 contrasting columns for
"Enclosure" and "Openness" across 3 layers (adapted from the OSI model, it
seems): physical, logical and content. See his footnote
[157](https://web.archive.org/web/20110525071000/http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/the_wealth_of_networks.yochai_benkler/11.html#_157).

Alongside Benkler, Travis is also an important early source on enclosure, as
Boyle suggests. His paper, "Pirates of the Information Infrastructure:
Blackstonian Copyright and the First Amendment," was " a winner of the 1999
Berkeley Technology Law Journal Comment Competition," which would explain how it
came to be so widely cited when Travis was only in his last year at Harvard Law
School. Travis also cites E.P. Thompson and other writers from the Marxist
tradition without provisos, something later scholars were reluctant to do, with
the possible exception of Boyle. In particular, he cites Chapter III from
Thompson's 1991 _Customs in Common_, which is an extension of his earlier _Whigs
and Hunters_ but provides much more context on the history of enclosure.

Hess and Ostrom provide a good overview of the use of the term "commons" with
regard to intellectual property, in the "Ideas, Artifacts and Facilities" §
"What Is a Commons?". They also edited a book length collection in 2007 called
_Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice_.


I don't believe Boyle's _Shamans, Software & Spleens_ contains any references,
even though I haven't been able to access the full text, because I have been
able to search it via Google Books but that turned up zero results. It's also
not present in an older publication from 1992, ["A Theory of Law and
Information: Copyright, Spleens, Blackmail and Insider
Trading"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/law&info.htm), which contains early
versions of a few of the same articles later expanded upon in the book. It is,
however, present in the 2000 work, ["Cruel, Mean, or Lavish? Economic Analysis,
Price Discrimination and Digital Intellectual
Property"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/cruel.pdf).

So I think that leaves Benkler and Travis with the earliest use of the metaphor,
at least with regard to IP law specifically, which Boyle and Bollier would
expand upon very soon after.

### UPDATE
I regret I overlooked Christopher May, one of the names cited by Boyle in "The
Second Enclosure Movement." His analysis of information enclosures is as it
includes of survey of Marxian and anarchist (Proudhon, Robert Cox, Nozick, etc)
interpretations of enclosure, as applied to IP. He also shares some important
citations with Bollier in _The Global Political Economy of Intellectual Property
Rights_, such as Radin, Boyle, Reichman, particularly in chapter 6.

Also, Vandana Shiva was years ahead of everyone else in the Duke/Harvard Law
circles on all the most critical issues of enclosure, linking agricultural and
intellectual commons, the central role women played in both, and the ways that
European enclosures were expanded through colonization. Her 1997 _Biopiracy_ and
its first and fourth chapters are particularly relevant. She is cited by both
Bollier and May.

Both May and Shiva give considerable attention to the TRIPS agreements, which
were still being actively developed in the late nineties by the WTO, as well as
its predecessor, GATT.

## The Californian Ideology
In _From Counterculture to Cyberculture_ (pp. 258-260), Fred Turner cites Ellen
Ullman's 1997, _Close to the Machine_, a testament to the alienating work/life
culture of the late nineties tech boom. Turner then comments on the overlooked
material elements of what techno-utopians back in the 1980's and 90's lauded as
the coming information society:

> To stay employed, Ullman and workers like her must move from node to node
> within the network of sites where computers and software are manufactured and
> used, and in order to pick up leads for new work, they must stay in touch with
> one another. As a result, programmers and others often find themselves living
> in a social and physical landscape populated principally by people like
> themselves. To succeed within that landscape, they must often turn their
> attention away from another, parallel landscape: the landscape of local,
> material things, of town boards and PTA meetings, of embodied participation in
> civic life. They must declare and maintain an allegiance to their own
> professional network, to its sites and technologies. And they must carry with
> them a handful of rules that Ullman trumpets with more than a little sarcasm:
> “Just live by your wits and expect everyone else to do the same. Carry no dead
> wood. Live free or die. Yeah, surely, you can only rely on yourself.”[^22t]
> 
> For those like Ullman who have the education, the professional skills, and the

The relevant section from Richard Barbrook's and Andy Cameron's "The Californian
Ideology", as published in _Mute_, 1995:

> ### The Rise of the Virtual Class
> Although companies in these sectors can mechanise and sub-contract much of
> their labour needs, they remain dependent on key people who can research and
> create original products, from software programs and computer chips to books
> and tv programmes. These skilled workers and entrepreneurs form the so-called

> engineers, computer scientists, video-game developers, and all the other
> communications specialists...' (Kroker and Weinstein). Unable to subject them
> to the discipline of the assembly-line or replace them by machines, managers
> have organised such intellectual workers through fixed-term contracts. Like
> the 'labour aristocracy' of the last century, core personnel in the media,
> computing and telecoms industries experience the rewards and insecurities of

> Lacking the free time of the hippies, work itself ho become the main route to

> 
> Because these core workers are both a privileged part of the labour force and

These three sections are also significant for calling out the hypocrisy of the
communalists-turned-technocrats:

> ### The Myth of the Free Market

In 2013, Turner gave a keynote lecture for The Anthropocene Project in Berlin,
based on his book. He traces the thread from the early cybernetics movements of
the 40's and 50's, to the counter culture and communes of the 60's, then to
silicon valley culture of the 70's and 80's, and finally to the emergence of
neo-libaral capitalism in the 90's and 00's. The whole talk is fantastic, but
when he explicitly links these themes to farming toward the end, at
[38m30s](https://youtu.be/6Py_P1_cHUE?t=2310), it practically gave me chills:

> You know, I think in many ways the New Communalist dreams of "communities of

> is that that ethos helped underwrite the emergence of a highly individualized
> kind of economy that's very rough to live in. Contract labor is a very hard
> way to live and it's a way that increasing numbers of Americans are living.
> Blending your community and your labor sounds fun, until you've worked on a

## The limits of a liberal theory of the commons
In _The Wealth of Networks_, as the titular reference might suggest, Benkler
fits squarely into the two Post-Cold War camps of neoclassical economics and
liberal political theory, extrapolating neatly from a line of thought that
passes through both Adam Smith and John Rawls. He acknowledges this position,
though it is by no means without nuance or qualifications:

> There are four methodological choices represented by the thesis that I have
> outlined up to this point, and therefore in this book as a whole, which
> require explication and defense. The first is that I assign a very significant
> role to technology. The second is that I offer an explanation centered on
> social relations, but operating in the domain of economics, rather than
> sociology. The third and fourth are more internal to liberal political theory.
> The third is that I am offering a liberal political theory, but taking a path
> that has usually been resisted in that literature—considering economic
> structure and the limits of the market and its supporting institutions from
> the perspective of freedom, rather than accepting the market as it is, and
> defending or criticizing adjustments through the lens of distributive justice.
> Fourth, my approach heavily emphasizes individual action in nonmarket
> relations. Much of the discussion revolves around the choice between markets
> and nonmarket social behavior. In much of it, the state plays no role, or is
> perceived as playing a primarily negative role, in a way that is alien to the
> progressive branches of liberal political thought. In this, it seems more of a
> libertarian or an anarchistic thesis than a liberal one. I do not completely
> discount the state, as I will explain. But I do suggest that what is special
> about our moment is the rising efficacy of individuals and loose, nonmarket
> affiliations as agents of political economy. Just like the market, the state
> will have to adjust to this new emerging modality of human action. Liberal
> political theory must first recognize and understand it before it can begin to
> renegotiate its agenda for the liberal state, progressive or otherwise.

## Coding assets and nature as capital
Katherina Pistor on property 'absolutism' and rights held _erga omnes_ or
"against the world" (p. 15):

> The third attribute is universality, which not only ensures that priority and
> durability will affect the parties who agreed to be bound by them, but that
> these attributes will be upheld against anybody, or _erga omnes_ in Latin
> legalese. Universality sheds a crucial light on the nature of capital and its
> relation to state power. A simple agreement between two parties can exert
> influence only between the two contracting parties, but it cannot bind others.
> It takes a powerful third party to extend priority and durability rights
> against the world such that others will yield.

How capital is coded into law:

> Capital is coded in law, and, more specifically, in institutions of private
> law, including property, collateral, trust, corporate, bankruptcy law, and
> contract law. These are the legal modules that bestow critical legal
> attributes on the select assets that give them a comparative advantage over
> others in creating new and protecting old wealth. Once properly coded, capital
> assets enjoy priority and durability, are convertible into cash, or legal
> tender, and, critically, these attributes will be enforced against the world,
> thereby attaining universality. This works because states back and, if
> necessary, coercively enforce the legal code of capital, whether or not they
> had a direct hand in choosing the coding strategy for the asset in question.
> Recognizing that capital is made, and not simply the product of superior
> skills, shifts attention to the processes by which different as- sets are
> slated for legal coding and to the states that endorse relevant legal modules
> and offer their coercive powers to enforce them. As I will show, this process
> is both decentralized and, in only seeming contradiction, increasingly global.
> Private attorneys perform most of the work on behalf of their clients, and
> states, for their part, offer their own legal systems as a menu from which
> private parties get to pick and choose. As a result, many polities have lost
> the ability to control the creation and distribution of wealth.

Katherina Pistor on the changes from Romano-Briton Law to Norman Law to English
Common Law (p. 30):

> Early English treaties compiled prior to the Norman conquest followed the
> Roman legal tradition, which treated land just like other objects of property
> rights.[^24] In Roman law a property right was considered an absolute right
> that included the right to use, possess, and alienate an asset. However,
> following the Norman conquest, legal practice in England increasingly ignored
> these treaties. For two centuries, from 1290 to 1490, the terms “property” and
> “ownership” dropped out of the vocabulary in court cases concerning land, even
> as these terms continued to be used for “chattel,” that is, goods and animals.
> Rights to land were neither unified nor absolute; there were only “greater” or
> “higher” rights, and only the king could claim an absolute right to the land.
> Yet, already by the end of the 1600s, a remarkable change had taken place. “A
> grand rule was emerging: whoever had the ‘general’ or ‘absolute’ property in a
> thing could assert the interest against everyone in the world, and whoever had
> the ‘special’ property (like a specific use right or collateral), could assert
> it against everyone but the ‘general’ or ‘absolute’ owner.”[^25]

Ultimately, enclosure created not just a pasture for their sheep, but a market
for their pasture (p. 32):

> The successful enclosure of the land created the conditions for an emerging
> land market—a radical change in societies that had revolved around stable
> relations to land, which provided sustenance and also served as the foundation

## _Biopiracy_
In 1997, half a decade after the governments and news media of Europe and North
America had celebrated the quincentenary of his "discovery," largely without
question, Vandana Shiva pronounced the "Second Coming of Columbus" as the advent
of new intellectual property regimes and free trade agreements (pp. 2-3):

> Five hundred years after Columbus, a more secular version of the same project
> of colonization continues through patents and intellectual property rights
> (IPRs). The Papal Bull has been replaced by the General Agreement on Tariffs
> and Trade (GATT) treaty. The principle of effective occupation by christian
> princes has been replaced by effective occupation by the transnational
> corporations supported by modern-day rulers. The vacancy of targeted lands has
> been replaced by the vacancy of targeted life forms and species manipulated by
> the new biotechnologies. The duty to incorporate savages into Christianity has
> been replaced by the duty to incorporate local and national economies into the
> global marketplace, and to incorporate non-Western systems of knowledge into
> the reductionism of commercialized Western science and technology.
> 
> The creation of property through piracy of others wealth remains the same as
> 500 years ago.
> 
> The freedom that transnational corporations are claiming through intellectual
> property rights protection in the GATT agreement on Trade Related Intellectual
> Property Rights (TRIPs) is the freedom that European colonizers have claimed
> since 1492. Columbus set a precedent when he treated the license to conquer
> non-European peoples as a natural right of European men. The land titles
> issued by the pope through European kings and queens were the first patents.
> The colonizer's freedom was built on the slavery and subjugation of the people
> with original rights to the land. This violent takeover was rendered "natural"
> by defining the colonized people as nature, thus denying them their humanity
> and freedom.

She then situates this process explicitly within the history of enclosure, and
derives a definition of capital based upon that history (p. 3, emphasis added):

> John Locke's treatise on property effectually legitimized this same process of
> theft and robbery during the enclosure movement in Europe. Locke clearly
> articulated capitalism's freedom to build as the freedom to steal; property is
> created by removing resources from nature and mixing them with labor. this
> "labor" is not physical, but labor in its "spiritual" form, as manifested in
> the control of capital. According to Locke, only those who own capital have
> the natural right to own natural resources, a right that supersedes the common
> rights of others with prior claims. __Capital is thus defined as a source of
> freedom that, at the same time, denies freedom to the land, forests, rivers,
> and biodiversity that capital claims as its own and to others whose rights are
> based on their labor.__ Returning private property to the commons is perceived
> as depriving the owner of capital of freedom. Therefore, peasants and
> tribespeople who demand the return of their rights and access to resources are
> regarded as thieves.

<!-- Removed from "The Commons that Never Were Enclosed" -->
Indeed, some of those charters granted in that first fit of colonization would
be called "patents," though the more revealing term for them was "royal
monopolies." Expropriation by royal or papal decree was invested with republican
legitimacy in 1823, when U.S. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Marshall cited
Pope Alexander VI as he set down his own so-called "doctrine of discovery." That
ruling not only led to a violent escalation in the theft of native lands on the
North American continent, but also had a profound effect on international law
that reverberates to this day.

More from _Biopiracy_, pp. 4-5:

> The assumption of empty lands, terra nullius, is now being expanded to "empty
> life," seeds and medicinal plants. The takeover of native resources during
> colonization was justified on the ground that indigenous people did not
> "improve" their land. As John Winthrop wrote in 1869:
> 
> > Natives in New England, they enclose no land, neither have they any settled
> > habitation, nor any tame cattle to improve the land by soe have nor other
> > but a Natural Right to those countries. Soe as if we leane them sufficient

> 
> The same logic is now used to appropriate biodiversity from the original
> owners and innovators by defining their seeds, medicinal plants, and medical

## Public Goods & Market Enclosure
David Bollier on the difference between "open-access" and the commons (_Silent
Theft_, p. 20)[^silent-theft]:

[^silent-theft]: Some of this material can also be found in his 2002 article for
the _Boston Review_, ["Reclaiming the

the
Commons"](https://www.bollier.org/week-5-dynamics-modern-enclosure-governing-commons),
which isn't timestamped but seems to predate _Frontiers of Commoning_.

> This pessimism persists, in part, because the commons is frequently confused

Enclosure of the organic foods movement by the industrial agriculture and the

Richard Stallman observed in the early 1980's that software is enclosed by
