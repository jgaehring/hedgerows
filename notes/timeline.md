[^WF]: Whole Foods' first store in NYC [opened in Chelsea in Feb 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317065428/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/14/dining/new-market-concentrates-on-organic-food.html).
    The _Austin Business Journal_ notes refers to their Austin HQ as
    "the new 80,000-square-foot store -- the company's largest" in
    ["New Whole Foods headquarters set for grand opening"](https://web.archive.org/web/20050225051404/https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2005/02/21/daily13.html) (Feb 22, 2005).
    Compare with the [history page on the Whole Foods website](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/company-info/whole-foods-market-history):

    > Two years later, John and Renee partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with their Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market on September 20, 1980. At 10,500 square feet and a staff of 19, this store was quite large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time.
