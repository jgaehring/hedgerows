  - > [George] Akerlof showed that informational asymmetries can give rise to
    > [_adverse selection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection) on
    > markets. Due to imperfect information on the part of lenders or
    > prospective car buyers, borrowers with weak repayment prospects or sellers
    > of low-quality cars crowd out everyone else from the market.
  - > [Michael] Spence demonstrated that under certain conditions, well-informed
    > agents can improve their market outcome by
    > [_signaling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) their
    > private information to poorly informed agents.
  - > [Joseph] Stiglitz showed that an uninformed agent can sometimes capture
    > the information of a better-informed agent through
    > [_screening_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(economics)), for
    > example by providing choices from a menu of contracts for a particular
    > transaction. Insurance companies are thus able to divide their clients
    > into risk classes by offering different policies, where lower premiums can

    > sensibility: the view that production should be a symbiotic, not an
    > antagonistic, process. Although the movement was primarily aesthetic, it
    > combined with anarchist theories of mutualism — notably Kropotkin's
    > extraordinarily prescient writings — to ferret out a much broader "natural
    > design": a "marriage" between labor and nature that was conceived not as a
    > patriarchal domination of "man" over nature but as a productive
    > relationship based on harmony, fertility, and creativity. Libertarian and
    > aesthetic movements in the nineteenth century were still heir to the image
    > of a fecund interaction between humanity's craft and nature's
    > potentialities. But labor was seen not as "fire," or industry as a
    > "furnace." The imagery of these movements was drastically different. Labor
    > was viewed as the midwife, and tools as the aids, in delivering nature's

### Criticism
- Low marginal costs and non-rivalry are over-emphasized and consequently taken
  as the preconditions for effective commons
- It is implicitly and mistakenly assumed that information is not a "thing" like
  real property. Likewise, tangible things are viewed as substantively different
  from information and their informational component is either minimized or
  overlooked entirely.
