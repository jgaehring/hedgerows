## Draft Materials & References
Enclosure is more than just a simple barrier or boundary: it is a severing of the ties that connect us to other people and living creatures, while uprooting us from the land and, more generally, our sense of place.

Both knowledge and land must be given back to the whole at some point

Technology and open source software became deeply politicized for me in 2012 in a way that food and farming had never been.

Richard Stallman observed in the early 1980's that software is enclosed by
denying users access to freely read, modify and share the source code. Two
decades later, Lawrence Lessig brought attention to the way codes of law can
restrict or enable the codes of software, but that the later can also be used to
supplant, obscure or evade the former. As he more succinctly put it: "Code _is_
law."

### Medieval Commons and Their Holdovers
Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen, "The Institutional Aspects of Peasant Communities: An Analytical View" (1965):

> Another institution sets in even stronger light the idea that land is to be
> used, not to be owned by exclusion. It is the custom called "open field
> pasture" in England, _vaine pâture_ in France and _Gemenglad der Felder_ in
> Germany. According to it, after harvest all fields are opened for pasture to
> everyone's cattle and remain so until the next tilling. Once the practice was
> common to all European countries; it survived in many parts of Western Europe
> well into our own time.

Open field agriculture was prevalent in Ireland, too, where it was called rundale, until those farmers were dispossessed by English settlers and the plantation system, starting in the 1580's. This was an important proving ground for Britain's colonial methods, which they would later perfect in the expropriation of the Americas' common landholdings, from Virginia to Belize. In the Scottish Highlands, the similarly named run-rig system continued through the late 18th century, coinciding with the Scottish Enlightenment that produced _The Wealth of Nations_ and a wave of land privatization consistent with that book's core tenets. Today, the village of [Laxton](http://www.laxtonvisitorcentre.org.uk/), Nottinghamshire, retains the last open field system in England. Three fields are still held in common ownership, little changed from detailed maps of the area from 1635. A fourth field was lost only in 1903, during the final era of Parliamentary enclosure. The farmers of Laxton — in a sophisticated practice combining regular crop rotation and fallow periods, intermittent grazing and permanent pasture lanes — are apportioned strips of land from each of the fields, a tradition that has likely endured for over half a millennium.

Elsewhere, the Russian _obshchina_ or _mir_[^mir] persisted in its medieval form as late as 1861, when Tsar Alexander II emancipated the serfs. It has even been argued that a kernel of communal land practice held out until the Soviet Union undertook collectivization in the 1920's. In Mexico, the revolutionary Constitution of 1917 and subsequent land reforms of Lázaro Cárdenas established the system of _ejidos_. These remained largely in tact until the relevant articles were repealed from the constitution at the behest of neoliberal policy makers as a prerequisite to joining NAFTA. The Zapatista uprising was launched the day NAFTA took effect on January 1, 1994, and to this day the EZLN defends the _ejidos_ of Chiapas from further enclosures. This is all to say nothing of the indigenous land practices which have successfully resisted colonial encroachment and land enclosures for centuries across the globe, but I feel ill-equipped to speak to that vast history of struggle.

[^mir]: This is indeed the same name given to the Russian space station _Мир_ in
    1986, although the term has a broader meaning that carries with it the sense
    of "world," "planet" and "peace". See _Afterburner_, ["Space Station ´Mir´ –
    the symbol of Soviet supremacy in space, that reconciliated
    nations"](https://afterburner.com.pl/space-station-mir-the-symbol-of-soviet-supremacy-in-space-that-reconciliated-nations/).
    Also, Robert Ellickson backs up that _miri_ were still in practice as
    late as Stalin's collectivization ("Property in Land" p. 1393)


### Stealing the Commons from off the Goose
via James Boyle's 2003 ["The Second Enclosure Movement and the Construction of the Public Domain"](https://scholarship.law.duke.edu/lcp/vol66/iss1/2/):


> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> But leaves the greater villain loose  
> Who steals the common from off the goose.  
>   
> The law demands that we atone  
> When we take things we do not own  
> But leaves the lords and ladies fine  
> Who take things that are yours and mine.  
>   
> The poor and wretched don’t escape  
> If they conspire the law to break;  
> This must be so but they endure  
> Those who conspire to make the law.  
>   
> The law locks up the man or woman  
> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> And geese will still a common lack  
> Till they go and steal it back.  

Boyle's essay, as published by Duke Law in 2003, provides the most thorough commentary on the poem's provenance, at least that I have found to-date:

> Apart from being anonymous, the poem is extremely hard to date. It probably comes from the enclosure controversies of the eighteenth century. However, the earliest reference to it that I have been able to discover is from 1821. Edward Birch was moved to compose some (fairly poor) verses in response when he reported “seeing the following jeu d’esprit in a Handbill posted up in Plaistow, as a ‘CAUTION’ to prevent persons from supporting the intended inclosure of Hainault or Waltham Forest.” He then quotes a version of the poem. Edward Birch, TICKLER MAG., Feb. 1821, at 45. In 1860, a staff writer for the journal Notes and Queries declares that “the animosity excited against the Inclosure Acts and their authors . . . was almost without precedent: though fifty years and more have passed, the subject is still a sore one in many parishes. . . . I remember some years ago, in hunting over an old library discovering a box full of printed squibs, satires and ballads of the time against the acts and those who were supposed to favour them,—the library having belonged to a gentleman who played an active part on the opposition side.” The author then quotes the first verse as a “naive epigram . . . which forcibly impressed itself on my memory.” “Exon” Ballads Against Inclosures, 9 NOTES AND QUERIES, at 130-131 (2nd ser., Feb. 1860). The context makes it appear that the poem itself must date from the late 18th century. In other sources, the poem is sometimes dated at 1764 and said to be in response to Sir Charles Pratt’s fencing of common land. See, e.g., Dana A. Freiburger, John Thompson, English Philomath—A Question of Land Surveying and Astronomy, poster paper submitted to the History of Astronomy Workshop University of Notre Dame, (July 1-4, 1999), note 15, available at http://www.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/index.html (last visited Dec. 19, 2002). This attribution is widespread and may well be true, but I have been able to discover no contemporary source material that sustains it. By the end of the nineteenth century, the poem was being quoted, sometimes with amusement and sometimes with agreement, on both sides of the Atlantic. See Ezra S. Carr, Aids and Obstacles to Agriculture on the Pacific-Coast, in THE PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY ON THE PACIFIC COAST 290, 291 (San Francisco, A.L. Bancroft and Co. 1875); EDWARD P. CHEYNEY, AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND 219 (1901).

The paper from self-ascribed "independent scholar" Dana A. Frieburger, ["John Thompson, English Philomath — A Question of Land Surveying and Astronomy"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718033403/https://www3.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/index.html), is available on the Internet Archive. Contemporaneously with Boyle, or even preceding him by a narrow margin, David Bollier uses the poem as an epigraph to his 2002 book, [_Silent Theft: the Private Plunder of our Common Wealth_](https://archive.org/details/silenttheftpriva00boll/page/n13/mode/2up). Bollier also uses a different portion of the poem (not included in his or Boyle's epigraph) to an article for the _Boston Review_, ["Reclaiming the Commons"](https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/david-bollier-reclaiming-commons/), published June 1, 2002. It's unclear if this usage predates Boyle's usage, as Boyle's first footnote points to an earlier iteration of his paper, titled ["Fencing off ideas: enclosure and the disappearance of the public domain"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/daedalus.pdf), published in the Spring 2002 edition of _Daedalus_.

Peter Linebaugh's attribution, where he cites the same poem in _Stop, Thief!_, cites relevant scholarship on the commons from the 20th Century Marxist and tradition and critical theory, but I have not found specific reference to that poem in any of these works that I've so far been able to access:

> E.J. Hobsbawm, Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries (New York: W.W. Norton, 1959); and from the Warwick School of Social History, our collective’s Albion’s Fatal Tree: Crime and Society in Eighteenth-Century England (London: Allen Lane, 1975) and E.P. Thompson’s Whigs and Hunters (London: Allen Lane, 1975). Verso published a second edition of Albion’s Fatal Tree in 2011, and Breviary Stuff published a new edition of Whigs and Hunters in 2013. See also the “Frankfurt School” study by Georg Rusche and Otto Kirchheimer, Punishment and Social Structure (New York: Columbia University Press, 1939), and the influential work by Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, translated by Alan Sheridan (New York: Vintage, 1977).

### Historiography of Enclosure
In "The Second Enclosure Movement", Boyle lays out his main thesis plainly:

> We are in the middle of a second enclosure movement. It sounds grandiloquent
to call it “the enclosure of the intangible commons of the mind,” but in a very
real sense that is just what it is. (p. 37)

The footnote to the above reads:

>  The analogy to the enclosure movement has been too succulent to resist. To my
knowledge, Ben Kaplan, Pamela Samuelson, Yochai Benkler, David Lange, Chrisopher
May, David Bollier and Keith Aoki have all employed the trope, as I myself have
on previous occasions. For a particularly thoughtful and careful development of
the parallel between the two enclosure movements, see generally Travis, supra
note 7. (p. 37, n. 12)

Acknowledging Lange, once again:

> Thus, there are a number of possible places where one could say, “the defense
of the public domain begins here.” But, like most people, I attribute central
importance to the writing of my friend and colleague David Lange, whose article
Recognizing the Public Domain really initiated contemporary study of the
subject. (p. 59)

In a telling footnote (p. 176, n. 131), Lange admits:

> I should perhaps say clearly at this point that of course I do not mean to be
> taken literally when I suggest an analogy to public lands. Proposals of that
> sort too quickly lead to analysis rooted in reductive nonsense.

The footnote addresses a rather callous comparison of the public domain to "the
public grazing lands on the Western plains of a century ago," and the
environmental impact statements required for its private use. Yet he qualifies
even that analogy, because "so insubstantial is the stuff of intellelctual
property." He suggests that the Alaskan tundra, "singularly unsuited for
colonization," might make a fairer analogy, before dismissing both as nonsense.

Here's the full context:

> In this final portion of my own essay, I will suggest some other ways courts
> might respond when unwarranted claims of intellectual property are advanced.

Then, after providing the first two methods:

> Third, as an additional part of the plaintiff's prima facie case, it would
> seem fair to require the submission of proof concerning the likely impact that
> recognition of the plaintiff's claim might have on subsequent claims. [...]
> The analogy that comes to mind is the environmental impact statement that must
> be prepared when, for example, government agencies propose to make some
> doubtful use of lands. The purpose of these statements is generally to require
> that, as against the uncontrolled ravages wrought in earlier times, would-be
> users today assure us that their proposals will not heedlessly affect the
> interests of individuals in generations to come.'<sup>129</sup> The analogy
> here seems apt; in certain useful respects the public domain in the field of
> intellectual property today can be compared to the public grazing lands on the
> Western plains of a century ago.<sup>130</sup> Indeed, so insubstantial is the
> stuff of intellectual property that the more insistent image is not the
> sturdier lands of the American West but the more fragile tundra of the Alaskan
> North: wild, vast, inaccessible, beautiful, but singularly unsuited to
> colonization.<sup>131</sup> If it is fair, as we seem to have decided in this
> century it is, to require the users of public lands to prepare impact
> statements as a condition of their use, then perhaps it is also fair to
> require similar assurances before we permit the outright appropriation of the
> territory of the creative subconscious.<sup>132</sup>
>
> 129. _See generally_ F. Anderson, NEPA in the Courts (1973).  
>      A California practitioner, writing some years ago in response to
>      then-recent litigation involving Nancy Sinatra and the Fifth Dimension,
>      captured the essence of the concerns expressed in the text at this point:
>      [...]
> 130. Or to public lands of other sorts. _See_ Krasilovsky, _supra_ note 20, at
>      205, 225-26.
> 131. _But cf. id._ at 225-26 (suggesting the development of the Alaskan crab
>      and shrimp industries as examples of how a federal bureau might be
>      established to manage, conserve and develop the public domain). If this
>      alarming suggestion were followed, impact statements would be even more
>      relevant.  
>      I should perhaps say clearly at this point that of course I do not mean
>      to be taken literally when I suggest an analogy to public lands.
>      Proposals of that sort too quickly lead to analysis rooted in reductive
>      nonsense. _Cf._ Comment, _Premature Burial_, _supra_ note 20, at 996-97.
> 132. One author has used the term "public commons" to describe "the raw
>      materials from which creative imaginations must work" and which therefore
>      cannot be "fenced in" in any circumstances. Carman, _supra_ note 20, at
>      58,
>      59. _Cf._ Nimmer, _supra_ note 20, at 266.
> 133. _Cf._ Stone, _Should Trees Have Standing?— Toward Legal Rights for
>      Natural Objects_, 45 S. CAL. L. REV. 450 (1972).

Pay special attention to note 133, where he cites Christopher Stone's paper,
today considered a cornerstone of the legal arguments for Rights of Nature.

So dismissing Lange, we come back to Benkler for the earliest comparison of
intellectual property, particularly copyright expansion, to early modern land
enclosures:

> - Free as the Air to Common Use: First Amendment Constraints on Enclosure of
>   the Public Domain, 74 N.Y.U. Law Review 354 (1999)
> - The Commons As A Neglected Factor of Information Policy (TPRC September 98)

Make sure to also acknowledge his _Wealth of Nations_, particularly "Table 11.1:
Overview of the Institutional Ecology," with its 2 contrasting columns for
"Enclosure" and "Openness" across 3 layers (adapted from the OSI model, it
seems): physical, logical and content. See his footnote
[157](https://web.archive.org/web/20110525071000/http://www.jus.uio.no/sisu/the_wealth_of_networks.yochai_benkler/11.html#_157).

Alongside Benkler, Travis is also an important early source on enclosure, as
Boyle suggests. His paper, "Pirates of the Information Infrastructure:
Blackstonian Copyright and the First Amendment," was " a winner of the 1999
Berkeley Technology Law Journal Comment Competition," which would explain how it
came to be so widely cited when Travis was only in his last year at Harvard Law
School. Travis also cites E.P. Thompson and other writers from the Marxist
tradition without provisos, something later scholars were reluctant to do, with
the possible exception of Boyle. In particular, he cites Chapter III from
Thompson's 1991 _Customs in Common_, which is an extension of his earlier _Whigs
and Hunters_ but provides much more context on the history of enclosure.

Hess and Ostrom provide a good overview of the use of the term "commons" with
regard to intellectual property, in the "Ideas, Artifacts and Facilities" §
"What Is a Commons?". They also edited a book length collection in 2007 called
_Understanding Knowledge as a Commons: From Theory to Practice_.


I don't believe Boyle's _Shamans, Software & Spleens_ contains any references,
even though I haven't been able to access the full text, because I have been
able to search it via Google Books but that turned up zero results. It's also
not present in an older publication from 1992, ["A Theory of Law and
Information: Copyright, Spleens, Blackmail and Insider
Trading"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/law&info.htm), which contains early
versions of a few of the same articles later expanded upon in the book. It is,
however, present in the 2000 work, ["Cruel, Mean, or Lavish? Economic Analysis,
Price Discrimination and Digital Intellectual
Property"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/cruel.pdf).

So I think that leaves Benkler and Travis as the earliest of the metaphor, which
Boyle and Bollier would expand upon very soon after.

### The limits of a liberal theory of the commons
In _The Wealth of Networks_, as the titular reference might suggest, Benkler
fits squarely into the two Post-Cold War camps of neoclassical economics and
liberal political theory, extrapolating neatly from a line of thought that
passes through both Adam Smith and John Rawls. He acknowledges this position,
though it is by no means without nuance or qualifications:

> There are four methodological choices represented by the thesis that I have
> outlined up to this point, and therefore in this book as a whole, which
> require explication and defense. The first is that I assign a very significant
> role to technology. The second is that I offer an explanation centered on
> social relations, but operating in the domain of economics, rather than
> sociology. The third and fourth are more internal to liberal political theory.
> The third is that I am offering a liberal political theory, but taking a path
> that has usually been resisted in that literature—considering economic
> structure and the limits of the market and its supporting institutions from
> the perspective of freedom, rather than accepting the market as it is, and
> defending or criticizing adjustments through the lens of distributive justice.
> Fourth, my approach heavily emphasizes individual action in nonmarket
> relations. Much of the discussion revolves around the choice between markets
> and nonmarket social behavior. In much of it, the state plays no role, or is
> perceived as playing a primarily negative role, in a way that is alien to the
> progressive branches of liberal political thought. In this, it seems more of a
> libertarian or an anarchistic thesis than a liberal one. I do not completely
> discount the state, as I will explain. But I do suggest that what is special
> about our moment is the rising efficacy of individuals and loose, nonmarket
> affiliations as agents of political economy. Just like the market, the state
> will have to adjust to this new emerging modality of human action. Liberal
> political theory must first recognize and understand it before it can begin to
> renegotiate its agenda for the liberal state, progressive or otherwise.

  - [Informational asymmetries](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/economic-sciences/2001/popular-information/); the summary from the 2001 Nobel Prize in Economics is cited below.
    - > [George] Akerlof showed that informational asymmetries can give rise to [_adverse selection_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adverse_selection) on markets. Due to imperfect information on the part of lenders or prospective car buyers, borrowers with weak repayment prospects or sellers of low-quality cars crowd out everyone else from the market.
    - > [Michael] Spence demonstrated that under certain conditions, well-informed agents can improve their market outcome by [_signaling_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_(economics)) their private information to poorly informed agents.
    - > [Joseph] Stiglitz showed that an uninformed agent can sometimes capture the information of a better-informed agent through [_screening_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(economics)), for example by providing choices from a menu of contracts for a particular transaction. Insurance companies are thus able to divide their clients into risk classes by offering different policies, where lower premiums can be exchanged for a higher deductible.

      the minds. The list of "participants" (in-person attendees?) is
      staggering, a who's-who in the scholarship of the commons for the last
