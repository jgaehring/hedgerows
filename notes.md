# Notes
Enclosure is more than just a simple barrier or boundary: it is a severing of the ties that connect us to other people and living creatures, while uprooting us from the land and, more generally, our sense of place.

Both knowledge and land must be given back to the whole at some point

### Stealing the Commons from off the Goose
via [_On the Commons_](http://www.onthecommons.org/magazine/%E2%80%9Cstealing-common-goose%E2%80%9D#sthash.V1isYy7t.hvRTkOB9.dpbs):

> Who steals the goose from off the common  
> And geese will still a common lack  
> Till they go and steal it back.  

Boyle's essay, as published by Duke Law in 2003, provides the most thorough commentary on the poem's provenance, at least that I have found to-date:

> Apart from being anonymous, the poem is extremely hard to date. It probably comes from the enclosure controversies of the eighteenth century. However, the earliest reference to it that I have been able to discover is from 1821. Edward Birch was moved to compose some (fairly poor) verses in response when he reported “seeing the following jeu d’esprit in a Handbill posted up in Plaistow, as a ‘CAUTION’ to prevent persons from supporting the intended inclosure of Hainault or Waltham Forest.” He then quotes a version of the poem. Edward Birch, TICKLER MAG., Feb. 1821, at 45. In 1860, a staff writer for the journal Notes and Queries declares that “the animosity excited against the Inclosure Acts and their authors . . . was almost without precedent: though fifty years and more have passed, the subject is still a sore one in many parishes. . . . I remember some years ago, in hunting over an old library discovering a box full of printed squibs, satires and ballads of the time against the acts and those who were supposed to favour them,—the library having belonged to a gentleman who played an active part on the opposition side.” The author then quotes the first verse as a “naive epigram . . . which forcibly impressed itself on my memory.” “Exon” Ballads Against Inclosures, 9 NOTES AND QUERIES, at 130-131 (2nd ser., Feb. 1860). The context makes it appear that the poem itself must date from the late 18th century. In other sources, the poem is sometimes dated at 1764 and said to be in response to Sir Charles Pratt’s fencing of common land. See, e.g., Dana A. Freiburger, John Thompson, English Philomath—A Question of Land Surveying and Astronomy, poster paper submitted to the History of Astronomy Workshop University of Notre Dame, (July 1-4, 1999), note 15, available at http://www.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/index.html (last visited Dec. 19, 2002). This attribution is widespread and may well be true, but I have been able to discover no contemporary source material that sustains it. By the end of the nineteenth century, the poem was being quoted, sometimes with amusement and sometimes with agreement, on both sides of the Atlantic. See Ezra S. Carr, Aids and Obstacles to Agriculture on the Pacific-Coast, in THE PATRONS OF HUSBANDRY ON THE PACIFIC COAST 290, 291 (San Francisco, A.L. Bancroft and Co. 1875); EDWARD P. CHEYNEY, AN INTRODUCTION TO THE INDUSTRIAL AND SOCIAL HISTORY OF ENGLAND 219 (1901).

The paper from self-ascribed "independent scholar" Dana A. Frieburger, ["John Thompson, English Philomath — A Question of Land Surveying and Astronomy"](https://web.archive.org/web/20060718033403/https://www3.nd.edu/~histast4/exhibits/papers/Freiburger/index.html), is available on the Internet Archive. Contemporaneously with Boyle, or even preceding him by a narrow margin, David Bollier uses the poem as an epigraph to his 2002 book, [_Silent Theft: the Private Plunder of our Common Wealth_](https://archive.org/details/silenttheftpriva00boll/page/n13/mode/2up). Bollier also uses a different portion of the poem (not included in his or Boyle's epigraph) to an article for the _Boston Review_, ["Reclaiming the Commons"](https://www.bostonreview.net/forum/david-bollier-reclaiming-commons/), published June 1, 2002. It's unclear if this usage predates Boyle's usage, as Boyle's first footnote points to an earlier iteration of his paper, titled ["Fencing off ideas: enclosure and the disappearance of the public domain"](https://law.duke.edu/boylesite/daedalus.pdf), published in the Spring 2002 edition of _Daedalus_.

Peter Linebaugh's attribution, where he cites the same poem in _Stop, Thief!_, cites relevant scholarship on the commons from the 20th Century Marxist and tradition and critical theory, but I have not found specific reference to that poem in any of these works that I've so far been able to access:

> E.J. Hobsbawm, Primitive Rebels: Studies in Archaic Forms of Social Movement in the 19th and 20th Centuries (New York: W.W. Norton, 1959); and from the Warwick School of Social History, our collective’s Albion’s Fatal Tree: Crime and Society in Eighteenth-Century England (London: Allen Lane, 1975) and E.P. Thompson’s Whigs and Hunters (London: Allen Lane, 1975). Verso published a second edition of Albion’s Fatal Tree in 2011, and Breviary Stuff published a new edition of Whigs and Hunters in 2013. See also the “Frankfurt School” study by Georg Rusche and Otto Kirchheimer, Punishment and Social Structure (New York: Columbia University Press, 1939), and the influential work by Michel Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison, translated by Alan Sheridan (New York: Vintage, 1977).

[^WF]: Whole Foods' first store in NYC [opened in Chelsea in Feb 2001](https://web.archive.org/web/20160317065428/https://www.nytimes.com/2001/02/14/dining/new-market-concentrates-on-organic-food.html).
    The _Austin Business Journal_ notes refers to their Austin HQ as
    "the new 80,000-square-foot store -- the company's largest" in
    ["New Whole Foods headquarters set for grand opening"](https://web.archive.org/web/20050225051404/https://www.bizjournals.com/austin/stories/2005/02/21/daily13.html) (Feb 22, 2005).
    Compare with the [history page on the Whole Foods website](https://www.wholefoodsmarket.com/company-info/whole-foods-market-history):

    > Two years later, John and Renee partnered with Craig Weller and Mark Skiles to merge SaferWay with their Clarksville Natural Grocery, resulting in the opening of the original Whole Foods Market on September 20, 1980. At 10,500 square feet and a staff of 19, this store was quite large in comparison to the standard health food store of the time.

Due to imperfect information on the part of lenders or prospective car buyers, borrowers with weak repayment prospects or sellers of low-quality cars crowd out everyone else from the market.

    - > [Joseph] Stiglitz showed that an uninformed agent can sometimes capture the information of a better-informed agent through [_screening_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screening_(economics)), for example by providing choices from a menu of contracts for a particular transaction. Insurance companies are thus able to divide their clients into risk classes by offering different policies, where lower premiums can be exchanged for a higher deductible.
