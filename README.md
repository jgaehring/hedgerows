## Series Outline
This series' subject matter was originally intended to comprise a single essay,
but the material was far too expansive for a continuous piece and too
impractical to condense. Below is a top-level outline of the series as a whole,
followed by a brief abstract for each of the three parts in the series. More
detailed outlines are included in the notes.

- [Part 1]: __Concerning knowledge enclosures and how they may be truly leveled__
  - The Stolen Commons
  - The Forgotten Enclosures
  - The Commons that Never Were Enclosed
- [Part 2]: __A tale of two movements__
  - The Market is No Place for the Commons
  - From Luddite to Leetspeak
  - Meanwhile, Food Sovereignty...
- [Part 3]: __Towards the unified commons of food, land, and technology__
  - Late 19th & 20th c. re-examination of the commons
  - Enclosure & Colonialism
  - What Is to Be Done?

### Part 1: Concerning knowledge enclosures and how they may be truly leveled
The connections between free and open source software (FOSS) and sustainable
farming movements are examined by looking at the practical and metaphorical use
of historical techniques of commoning[^commoning] that each has alternatively
employed or discarded within their respective movements. While the free software
community has been far more explicit in embracing the commons since its
inception, it has narrowed the permissable scope of the "commonable" to what is
strictly abstract and ephemeral: namely, information. A historiography of land
enclosure is then recounted, showing how this critical counterpart to the
commons has been ignored or forgotten in its more recent depictions. Viewed as a
proxy for the physical and contingent aspects of the commons, and how the
commons can be lost if collective vigilance is not paid, the history of
political resistance to enclosure can be instructive for how the commons might
be restored today.

[^commoning]: I.e., the traditional forms of communal land tenure once
    prevalent in England and Europe from at least the 12th through 18th
    centuries.

### Part 2: A tale of two movements
The notion of the commons was conspicuously absent from the discourse of the
slow food movement and sustainable agriculture in the U.S. during the Clinton-Bush years. Even as more antiquated and provincial modes of producing and consuming
food came into vogue, the "locavore" and small family farming movements adhered
more closely to a characteristically American narrative of the homesteader or
the "rock-star" chef, an individualistic and isolationist stance that is sharply
at odds with the historical (or the contemporary majority world's) model of
smallholder farming and traditional foodways. It was left to more radical voices
emerging from the Occupy and hacktivist movements in the early- to mid-2010's to
breathe new life into a vision for the commons in America. Meanwhile, the rest
of the world never gave up the fight, and the resultant food sovereignty
movement and peasant food webs are finally getting the attention of some of us
here in the Northern Hemisphere.

### Part 3: Towards the unified commons of food, land, and technology
The commons never went away; many ways of practicing, thinking and writing about
the commons were always there, even in the U.S. and Europe, if you knew where to
look: from the Fourierists and Owenites of the 19th century and Georgists of the
Progressive Era, to the Marxian economists and historians of the Cold War Era
and the proponents of degrowth and municipalism who are still active today. No
critique of these movements' lasting impacts or full potentiality would be
complete, however, without a deep understanding of how enclosure has been
carried out on a mass scale in the form of Western Colonialism. The
ramifications touch upon food, land use, technology and the information economy
and show how the commons must be reconceived as encompassing all forms of
resource allocation if its restoration is to be achieved in our lifetimes.
